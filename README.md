# CIMR L2Ocean surface Wind speed Vector (OWV) ATBD

This repository holds the ATBD (JupyterBook) v1 for a prototype Level-2 Ocean Wind Vector product for the CIMR mission.

An HTML build of the ATBD is [online](https://cimr-algos.github.io/OceanWindVectors_ATBD/intro.html).

The ATBD was developed in the context of the ESA-funded CIMR DEVALGO study (2022-2024) (contract 4000137493). More information on the DEVALGO study
and other ATBDs it produced is available from [CIMR-Algos](https://github.com/CIMR-Algos).

This repository is based on an [ATBD-Template](https://github.com/CIMR-Algos/ATBD-Template). See the README file of the ATBD-Template for instructions
how to fetch and build the ATBD.
